## HT32SX Reference Design: PCB Antenna
<div align="center">
HT32SX can provide a big BOM cost reduction for your end-device! Check it out in the schematic reference!
</div>

In this reference design we provide the gerbers files for a dual layer 1.6mm stardand FR4 PCB. The ideia is a push-button style application, **including an antenna design suggestion**. This antenna was designed for RC2 (902MHz), but you can also do some tune adjustments using a PI network.
