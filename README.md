The HT32SX is a System-in-Package (SiP) device build for the Internet of Things providing a **ready-to-use** connectivity solution.
It means that you’ll have strong reduction in your BOM cost, aiming a fast integration, simple design and the lowest **time-to-market**. It provides both uplink (transmit) and downlink (receive) network communications. As a SigFox™ Monarch enabled device, it allows globetrotter devices to seamlessly roam across the planet taking advantage of the global SigFox™ network coverage without need of reconfiguration, this setup is done automatically.

## The SMALLEST Sigfox™ Monarch SiP in the world!

In this repository you can find all the information you'll need to star to build your IoT aplication using the HT32SX and the Sigfox™ network. You can develop aplications based in our [examples](/firmware_applications) using the [Keil uVision IDE](https://www.keil.com/download/product/). 

The HT32SX SiP uses an ARM M0+ Core powered by ST Microelectronics (STM32L052x8) that provides to software developers working with STM32 devices [a **free-to-use** tool suite](https://www2.keil.com/stmicroelectronics-stm32/mdk). The MDK-Essential for STM32F0, STM32G0 and STM32L0 edition includes the Arm C/C++ Compiler, the Keil RTX5 real-time operating system kernel, and the µVision IDE/Debugger. It only works with STM32 devices based on the Cortex-M0/M0+ cores and is limited to a code size of 256 KB. The STM32 peripherals can be configured using [STM32 CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) and the resulting project exported to MDK.

In summary you'll find here:
*  [Technical Documentation](/docs)
*  Examples - codes, aplication notes and design tips.
